					<h2>Siddha Aasan</h2>
					<a href="#" class="figure"><img src="images/Sidha Asan.jpg" alt=""></a>

																<p style = "margin-left: 50px;">
							Asana is the backbone of a seeker's life and posture is an important part of cultivation.
Various types of asanas have been mentioned in the scriptures such as Vyaghra Charm, Deer Shawl, Rhinestone Stone etc., today it is all unapproachable and also illegal.
After much research and trials, we have created a special posture that will give the seeker safety, accomplishment, success and also an environment that brings attention and concentration immediately.
The following proven materials have been used in postures.
1. Rhinestone - Siddha yogis have been doing spiritual practice in the rhinestone rock and in this posture we have filled rhinestones in kilos to create a perfect meditation air proven positive environment.<br>
2. Divine Gems - Gems have their own powers and their power is very powerful. And they are very powerful in their combined form. This asana consists of more than 65 gems which awaken and enlighten the whole body. It automatically awakens the various centers of the body and makes the entire cultivation room divine.<br>
3. Siddha Jadiya - 7 different divine roots which are taken from the divine trees like Sahadevi, Indrajal, White Gunja etc. are put in this posture so that the seeker gets the power and help of these divine Jadis.<br>
4. Sahadevi, Bilva, Morpankhi, Divyanjana, Indravil and Dronapushpi - All these instruments provide protection to the seeker and do not allow any disturbance and evil forces to break through the practice.<br>
5. Parda - Everyone is familiar with the power of Parda and in it the ball of Parda, Gandhak and Asbhaka (Shiva and Shakti) is inserted so that the seeker can get complete divinity and protection.<br>
6. Marine material - Dakshinwari conch, Gomti Chakra, Kauri, Lakshmi Chakra, Vishnu Chakra and many other materials are installed in this posture to make this asana divine.
7. Sri Chakra - This entire material is installed around the Sri Chakra (Sri Yantra), with which the Kalash and 5 Yantras are also installed, which make the whole posture perfect and help the seeker in quick attainment.<br>
8. Pyramids - Many multi pyramids engaged in this asana and together with the Gomti Chakra and Rhinestone increase the power of the entire posture manifold, as every multilier pyramid multiplies the power.<br>

This divine posture is indeed a boon and mandatory for every seeker. Due to this, the entry into meditation is quick. Air gets the energy and frequency of all celestial and all the planetary defects are automatically removed.
